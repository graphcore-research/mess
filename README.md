## What is MESS?

There are two main ways to use MESS
* **Learn** we have comprehensive articles covering electronic structure methods
  assuming minimal background knowledge in molecular simulations.
* **Build**: we provide a tinkering framework for building your own electronic structure
  simulations 

## Why MESS?
MESS is primarily motivated by the need to demystify the underpinnings of electronic 
structure simulations. The target audience is the collective molecular machine learning
community.  We identify this community as anyone working towards accelerating our
understanding of atomistic processes by combining physical models (e.g. density
functional theory) with methods that learn from data (e.g. deep neural networks).
