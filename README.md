## Motivation

MESS is primarily motivated by the need to demystify the underpinnings of electronic
structure simulations. The target audience is the collective molecular machine learning
community. We identify this community as anyone working towards accelerating our
understanding of atomistic processes by combining physical models (e.g. density
functional theory) with methods that learn from data (e.g. deep neural networks).

## Usage

There are two main ways to use MESS

- **Learn** we have comprehensive articles covering electronic structure methods
  assuming minimal background knowledge in molecular simulations.
- **Build**: we provide a tinkering framework for building your own electronic structure
  simulations

## License

The reader is encouraged to fork, edit, remix, and use the contents however they find
most useful. All content is covered by the permissve [MIT License](./LICENSE) to
encourage this. Our aim is to encourage a truly interdisciplinary approach to accelerate
our understanding of molecular scale processes.
